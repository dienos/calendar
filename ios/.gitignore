# Xcode
#
# Xcode builds intermediate and final products into a derived data directory. These
# should not be git-committed.
#
# Store your derived data and other Xcode-generated files outside your project source
# root. See the "Locations" panel in Xcode's preferences.

## Derived Data
#
# The Derived Data directory is a build cache. As such, it can be regenerated at
# any time and should not be committed.
